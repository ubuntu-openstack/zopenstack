# A mixed-architecture deployment with the control plane and storage
# services on x86, and multiple compute nodes on z/KVM, in line with
# the OpenStack-Telemetry charm store bundle which uses the current
# dev charm versions, aka the 'next charms'.
#
# This is a proof-of-concept test bundle, intended to be an example.
# It is not highly-available, nor is it soak tested.
# TODO: use 7 machines total, 6 for applications and services.  Use
# ceph and swift.
