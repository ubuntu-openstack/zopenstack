# Ubuntu OpenStack Newton s390x Native LPAR Validation

This validation scenario exercises a basic set of [OpenStack Charms](https://jujucharms.com/u/openstack-charmers)
and [s390x](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/S390X) packages to deploy
OpenStack Newton using [Juju](https://jujucharms.com) 2.0.2 on [Ubuntu Server](https://www.ubuntu.com/server)
16.04.

The Juju bundle, along with deployment procedures and post-deployment
configuration details are documented in the upstream
[OpenStack Charm Guide OpenStack-on-LXD section](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/charm-guide/openstack-on-lxd.html).

### Known Issues and Workarounds

[Bug 1639239](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1639239)

`ERROR nova ValueError: Invalid InitiatorConnector protocol specified ISCSI`

Nova and os-brick have known issues with s390x architectures in Newton as of this 
writing.  [Fixes](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1639239/comments/11) were 
committed to master in those projects, November 2016.  These fixes will need to 
be backported to Newton in order to provide out-of-the-box functionality.

Interested parties should track the status of Ubuntu Cloud Archive targets
in the [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1639239).

Until that lands, for dev/test scenarios, one can use this workaround on the nova-compute Juju unit after it is initially deployed and before it is attempted to be used.

1. First, deploy the OpenStack-on-LXD Newton bundle.  Wait for units to settle with `watch juju status`.
2. Next, SSH into the nova-compute unit with something like `juju ssh nova-compute/0`.
3. Now create a new file with the following contents, save this as `~/rough.patch`.  *This is NOT the proper patch/fix that has landed in the upstream project repos, nor is it what will be backported.  However, it will suffice as a simple temporary workaround.*

    ```
    sudo patch --verbose -Nb /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py < rough.patch
    sudo rm -fv /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/virt/libvirt/*pyc

    ```
